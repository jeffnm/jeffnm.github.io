I'm a librarian and web developer who likes trying and learning new things. My old personal site was 4 years old and looked pretty dated. I was proud of it as a grad student project in PHP, but it was an overwrought and unwieldy site that looked its age.

This site was built with Jekyll as an experiment, with some help from this helpful [guide](https://kateefly.github.io/) from Kate Flynn.
